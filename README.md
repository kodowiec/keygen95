# keygen95 

Just a very simple (my first in flutter) app to generate keys for Microsoft products from '95 era, as described by [medium.com](https://medium.com/@dgurney/so-you-want-to-generate-license-keys-for-old-microsoft-products-a355c8bf5408).

Button design kindly borrowed from [win95_flutter](https://github.com/filiph/win95_flutter).
